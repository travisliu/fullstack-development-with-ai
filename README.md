# Feature Flag Service

Welcome to the Feature Flag Service repository! This project is an open source implementation used as a case study in the book "Fullstack Development with AI: Techniques and Practices". The Feature Flag Service enables granular control, real-time updates, and detailed performance tracking for feature rollouts

## Purpose and Vision

The **Feature Flag Service** aims to revolutionize how organizations manage feature rollouts, providing a robust platform that allows for granular control, real-time updates, and detailed performance tracking. The vision is to become an essential tool for any team implementing continuous delivery and integration practices. By enabling selective feature visibility and real-time management, the service uniquely positions itself in the market as not just a tool, but a strategic asset that enhances the agility and responsiveness of product development cycles. The expected impact on target users includes faster time-to-market, reduced risk associated with deploying new features, and enhanced ability to respond to user feedback and market changes.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- **frontend**: Contains the code for the web-based user interface where users can manage feature flags .
- **backend**: Contains the server-side code that handles the core logic, API endpoints, and database interactions.
- **sdk**: Contains the Software Development Kits (SDKs) for various programming languages to integrate the Feature Flag Service into your applications.
- **docs**: Contains the documentation for the project, including installation guides, API documentation, and usage instructions.
